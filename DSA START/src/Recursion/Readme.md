# can we perform, marge short in string array. 
### yes, we can perform. the idea is to find out the lexico graphical order of the array element.
`compare to method return 0 if both string is iexicographicaly equal, -1 for a is less the b, positive integer means a is greater then b.`
##### let's code together.

# Majority of element questions, I have 3 Solution. 
1. Time complexity O(n^2) and space O(1); `USING NESTED LOOP`
2. Time complexity O(n) and space O(n); `USING HashMap`
3. Time complexity O(nlogn) and space complexity O(logn) `Depend on recursion tree`
4. This is the More optimized problem using Voting Algorithm. `update later`
